 <h1>
     ALEXANDROS - The dreamer.
 </h1>
 <p class= paragraph-text>
<h2>Alexander the great</h2> is one of the most well known emepereor in the world,
his empire was one of the biggest that the  world has ever seen. Ho fought againts 
the persian empire at a really young age, and he won with a soldier army smaller, 
just because of his courage and because of his will to win.
He was a curious man that wanted to see the whole world.
But before of this he was a dreamer. And his dream were big just as his heart.
 </p>

 <h2> Where Was Alexander the Great From?</h2>
 <p>
    Alexander III was born in Pella, Macedonia, in 356 B.C. to King Philip II and Queen Olympias—although 
    legend had it his father was none other than Zeus, the ruler of the Greek gods.

    Philip II was an impressive military man in his own right. He turned Macedonia (a region on the northern part of the Greek peninsula) 
    into a force to be reckoned with, and he fantasized about conquering the massive Persian Empire.
 </p>

 <h2>Bucephalus</h2>
 <p>
    At age 12, Alexander showed impressive courage when he tamed the wild horse Bucephalus, 
    an enormous stallion with a furious demeanor. 
    The horse became his battle companion for most of Alexander’s life.
    When Alexander was 13, Philip called on the great philosopher Aristotle to tutor his son. 
    Aristotle sparked and fostered Alexander’s interest in literature, science, medicine and philosophy.
    Alexander was just 16 when Philip went to battle the Byzantine Empire and left his son in charge of Macedonia.
     In 338 B.C., Alexander saw the opportunity to prove his military worth and led a cavalry 
     against the Sacred Band of Thebes—a supposedly unbeatable, 
     select army made up entirely of male lovers—during the Battle of Chaeronea.
    Alexander put his vigor and bravery on display, and his cavalry decimated the Sacred Band of Thebes.
 </p>
 <h2>Alexander Becomes King</h2>
<p>
    In 336 B.C., Alexander’s father Philip was assassinated by his bodyguard Pausanias. Just 20 years old, 
    Alexander claimed the Macedonian throne and killed his rivals before they could challenge his sovereignty.
    He also quashed rebellions for independence in northern Greece. Once he’d cleaned house, 
    Alexander left to follow in his father’s footsteps and continue Macedonia’s world domination.
    Alexander appointed the general Antipater as regent and headed for Persia with his army. 
    They crossed the Hellespont, a narrow strait between the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara, 
    and faced Persian and Greek forces at the Granicus River. Victory went to Alexander and the Macedonians.
    Alexander then headed south and easily took the city of Sardes. 
    But his army encountered resistance in the cities of Miletus, 
    Mylasa and Halicarnassus. Under siege yet not beaten, 
    Halicarnassus held out long enough for King Darius III, the newest Persian king, to amass a substantial army.
